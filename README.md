User Configuration Management System (Python Project)

A Python-based system to manage user configurations efficiently using file handling, structured data storage, and object-oriented programming. Ensures data consistency, validation, and maintainable code structure.

Project Overview

This project demonstrates core Python programming concepts by creating a system that allows users to store, retrieve, and validate configuration data. It applies object-oriented design principles to maintain modularity and scalability.

Features

Add, update, and delete user configurations

Validate input data for consistency

Store configurations in structured files (e.g., JSON, CSV)

Object-oriented and modular design for easy maintenance

Easy to extend with additional features

Technologies Used
